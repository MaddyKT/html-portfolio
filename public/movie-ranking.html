<h1>The Best Movies According to Maddy</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>This is my favorite anime movie. I think the art style and the deep 
    messages within the story are beutiful.</p>

<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>I feel like this one is just a timeless classic.</p>

<h3>Ready Player One</h3>
<p>VR has always been an interest of mine and although I wouldn't want to live in a dystopian future, 
    I would love to see the technologies in the movie come to reality.</p>
