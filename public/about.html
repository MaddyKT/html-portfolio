<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, I'm Maddy! Thank you so much for your interest in my work. I got started in web design a couple of years ago, 
  but only started my web developing business in 2024. Prior to that I was a full time nurse in an emergency room.
  I started learning about coding and web development in my free time, slowly building my skills. As I grew more
  confident in my abilities I decided to take on my first client. Over time my client base grew until I started being
  able to do web development as my full time job and keep nursing as a hobby on the side.</p>

<p>All of my website are custom made, from scratch. No pre-made templates, no third party website design companies.
  I build your website completely custom, just for you. 
</p>

<p>If you are a fan of my work and would like to have your own custom built website, please reach out to me and we
  will work together to build something special. I will get back to you with a quote within three business days of
  your free consultation call. You can find my contact details on my <a href="..\public\contact.html">Contact Me</a>
  page.
